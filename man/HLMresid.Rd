\title{Extracting residuals from two-level HLMs}
\usage{
HLMresid(object, level = c(1, 2), type = c("both", "LS", "EB", "marginal"), sim = NULL, semi.standardize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{a fitted model object of class \code{mer}.}

  \item{level}{the level from which the residuals should be
  extracted; either \code{1} or \code{2} (both can be
  specified).}

  \item{type}{the type of residual to be extracted;
  \code{"LS"}, \code{"EB"}, \code{"both"} (i.e. LS and EB),
  or \code{"marginal"}.}

  \item{sim}{an optional data vector containing a
  (simulated) response variable.}

  \item{semi.standardize}{if \code{TRUE} the
  semi-standardized residuals will also be returned. This
  argument is only used when \code{level = 1}.}
}
\value{
  If \code{type = "marginal"} is specified, a numeric
  vector of the marginal residuals is returned.  Otherwise,
  a data frame is returned containing the following:
  \itemize{ \item When \code{level=1}: the model frame, the
  residuals (\code{LS.resid} and/or \code{EB.resid}), the
  fitted values (\code{fitted}), and, if
  \code{semi.standardize = TRUE}, the diagonal elements of
  the hat matrix (\code{hat}), the semi-standardized
  residuals (\code{semi.std.resid})

  \item When \code{level=2}: the LS and/or EB residuals
  corresponding to each random effect.

  \item When \code{level = c(1, 2)}: a list with elements
  \code{level.1} and \code{level.2}. Each element is
  specified as stated above.  }
}
\description{
  This is a wrapper function to extract the residuals from
  a two-level normal hierarchical linear model (HLM) fit
  using \code{lmer}. The EB residuals are extracted using
  using the functions \code{resid} and \code{ranef} for
  levels 1 and 2, respectively.  To extract the LS
  residuals, \code{LSresids} is used.
