\usage{
\method{HLMresid}{default}(object, ...)

\method{HLMresid}{mer}(object, level, type = "EB", sim = NULL, standardize = FALSE, ...)

\method{HLMresid}{lmerMod}(object, level, type = "EB", sim = NULL, standardize = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{mer} or \code{lmerMod}.}

\item{...}{do not use}

\item{level}{which residuals should be extracted: 1 for within-group (case-level)
residuals, the name of a grouping factor (as defined in \code{flist} of the 
\code{mer} object) for between-group residuals, or \code{marginal}.}

\item{type}{how are the residuals predicted: either \code{"EB"} or \code{"LS"}
(the default is \code{"EB"}).}

\item{sim}{optional argument giving the data frame used for LS residuals. This
is used mainly for dealing with simulations.}

\item{standardize}{if \code{standardize = TRUE} the standardized
residuals will be returned; if \code{standardize = "semi"} then
the semi-standardized level-1 residuals will be returned. Note that
for higher-level residuals of \code{type = "LS"},  \code{standardize = TRUE} 
does not result in standardized residuals as they have not been implemented.}
}
\description{
\code{HLMresid} is a function that extracts residuals
from a hierarchical linear model fit
using \code{lmer}. That is, it is a unified framework that
extracts/calculates residuals from \code{mer} or \code{lmerMod} objects.
}
\details{
This function extracts residuals from the model, 
and can extract residuals
estimated using least squares (LS) or Empirical 
Bayes (EB). This unified framework
enables the analyst to more easily conduct
an upward residual analysis during model
exploration/checking.

The \code{HLMresid} function provides a wrapper that will extract
residuals from a fitted \code{mer} or \code{lmerMod} object. 
The function provides access to 
residual quantities already made available by the functions \code{resid} and
\code{ranef}, but adds additional functionality. Below is a list of types of
residuals that can be extracted.
\describe{
\item{raw level-1 residuals}{These are equivalent to the residuals extracted
by \code{resid} if \code{level = 1}, \code{type = "EB"}, and 
\code{standardize = FALSE} is specified. 
You can also specify \code{type = "LS"} for LS residuals
that are not equivalent to those from \code{resid}.}
\item{standardized level-1 residuals}{Specify \code{level = 1}, and 
\code{standardize = TRUE}. This works with both \code{type = "EB"} or \code{"LS"}.}
\item{semi-standardized level-1 residuals}{Specify \code{level = 1}, \code{type = "LS"} and 
\code{standardize = "semi"}.}
\item{raw group level residuals}{These are equivalent to extracting the 
predicted random effects for a given group using \code{ranef}. Set 
\code{level} to a grouping factor name and \code{type = "EB"}. \code{type = "LS"}
can also be specified, though this is less common.}
\item{standardized group level residuals}{Set 
\code{level} to a grouping factor name, \code{type = "EB"}, and 
\code{standardized = TRUE}. This will not produce standardized residuals for
\code{type = "LS"}.}
\item{marginal residuals}{The marginal residuals can be obtained by setting
\code{level = "marginal"}. Only \code{type = "EB"} is implemented.}
\item{cholesky residuals}{These are essentially standardized marginal residuals.
To obtain cholesky residuals set \code{level = "marginal"}, \code{type = "EB"},
and \code{standardize = TRUE}.}
}
Note that \code{standardize = "semi"} is only implemented for level-1 LS residuals.
