HLMdiag 0.1.5 ------------------------------------------------------
* Updates to NAMESPACE to fix compatibility issues

HLMdiag 0.1.4 ------------------------------------------------------
* Updates for compatibility with ggplot2 0.9.0

HLMdiag 0.1.3 ------------------------------------------------------
* Added "marginal" residuals to the type argument for HLMresid.

HLMdiag 0.1.2 ------------------------------------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
* Removed the formula argument from LSresids. The formula is now obtained automatically from the mer object. Note: we are still working on automatic recognition of math operators such as log(), but anything in I() is recognized.
* Added the function HLMresid, a wrapper that will extract both the LS and EB residuals given an mer object.
* Added a level argument to LSresids, so the function can extract LS residuals from either level of the model.

BUG FIXES: 
* Fixed the ordering of output from 'LSresids' to match the mode frame obtained from the mer object.

HLMdiag 0.1.1 ------------------------------------------------------
* Created 'adjust_lmList' class to handle fitting separate linear models when a factor is constant across the group.
* 'random_ls_coef' was removed and replaced by the 'coef' method for 'adjust_lmList' objects.
* Added 'rvc' diagnostic.
* Extended 'case_delete' from only handling deletion for fixed effects to also handling deletion for variance components.
* Improved 'dotplot_diag' to handle modified dotplots.
