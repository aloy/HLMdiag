Version 0.3.0
=============
DEVELOPMENT

* Influence diagnostics in HLMdiag 0.3.0 are available for two-level models fit
using the `lmer` function in lme4` or the `lme` function in `nlme`. I am still
working to implement these methods for higher-level models using `lme`.
* HLMdiag no longer loads lme4 automatically (see above for the reason).

NEW FEATURES

* The `rotate_ranef` function has been added. This function rotates the random 
effects in an effort to find the least confounded residuals for distributional 
assessment.

BUG FIXES
* `LSresids` was fixed for an issue with the order of the resulting data frame.
* `case_delete` was fixed so that numeric group labels work properly, which fixes an issue
with `rvc`.
* Fixed an issue with `group_qqnorm`, by using `ppoints` rather than `.SampleQuantiles`.
* Fixed an issue with `case_delete.lmerMod`, to use the `getME()` function to extract `n`.
* A bug in the calculation of the Cholesky residuals was fixed (thanks to Harry Hiemstra for reporting the bug and the fix)


Version 0.2.5
=============
* Fixed a compatibility issue with Rcpp

Version 0.2.4
=============
* Added citation for the JSS paper
* Fixed a bug with the calculation of Cook's distance

Version 0.2.3
=============
* Added a function to calculate rotated random effects
* Added new data sets
* Maintenance for compatibility with lme4 1.0 and R 3.0.2

Version 0.2.2 
=============
* Changed the standardization of the EB level-1 residuals in `HLMresid` 
to a more appropriate definition: e / var(\hat{e}).
* Added functions to add compatibility with the development version of lme4.


Version 0.2.1 
=============
* Fixed a bug in `group_qqnorm`
* Checked compatibility with R 2.15.3


Version 0.2.0 
=============
DEVELOPMENT

* Influence diagnostics in HLMdiag 0.2.0 are compatible with hierarchical 
(multilevel) linear models of any size and with models with crossed factors.
* HLMdiag 0.2.0 offers significantly faster computation of the deletion
diagnostics for fixed effects that are based on one-step approximations.
* S3 methods have been created for `cooks.distance`, `mdffits`, `covratio`,
`covtrace`, `rvc`, and `leverage` for objects of class `mer`.
* Full deletions are still available using the `case_delete` function, with
corresponding S3 methods for objects of class `case_delete`.

NEW FEATURES

* A `leverage` function has been added.
* `case_delete` and other deletion functions now allow for the user to 
manually specify a subset to delete.

OTHER USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

* changes to the arguments of `dotplot_diag` to accomodate a more general
usage.
* `diagnostics` no longer requires a `model` parameter to be specified.
* A `delete` parameter has been added to `case_delete` to allow for manual
specification of a subset that should be deleted.
* For observation-level deletion using `case_delete` the user should specify
`group = NULL` rather than `group = FALSE`.


Version 0.1.6 
=============
* Updates for compatibility with ggplot2 >= 0.9.2
* Updates to NAMESPACE

Version 0.1.5 
=============
* Updates to NAMESPACE to fix compatibility issues

Version 0.1.4 
=============
* Updates for compatibility with ggplot2 0.9.0

Version 0.1.3 
=============
* Added "marginal" residuals to the type argument for HLMresid.

Version 0.1.2 
=============

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
* Removed the formula argument from LSresids. The formula is now obtained automatically from the mer object. Note: we are still working on automatic recognition of math operators such as log(), but anything in I() is recognized.
* Added the function HLMresid, a wrapper that will extract both the LS and EB residuals given an mer object.
* Added a level argument to LSresids, so the function can extract LS residuals from either level of the model.

BUG FIXES: 
* Fixed the ordering of output from 'LSresids' to match the mode frame obtained from the mer object.

Version 0.1.1 
=============
* Created 'adjust_lmList' class to handle fitting separate linear models when a factor is constant across the group.
* 'random_ls_coef' was removed and replaced by the 'coef' method for 'adjust_lmList' objects.
* Added 'rvc' diagnostic.
* Extended 'case_delete' from only handling deletion for fixed effects to also handling deletion for variance components.
* Improved 'dotplot_diag' to handle modified dotplots.
