    linear models

Description: A suite of diagnostic tools for two-level
    normal hierarchical linear models. The package offers
    not only traditional case-deletion diagnostics (Cook's
    distance, covratio, covtrace, and MDFFITS) but also
    provides graphics for residual analysis. Currently,
    case deletion is performed by iteratively refitting the
    model using lmer in the lme4 package, so for data sets
    with many groups, computation is currently slow.
