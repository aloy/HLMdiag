Description: A suite of diagnostic tools for hierarchical
    (multilevel) linear models. The package offers
    not only leverage and traditional deletion diagnostics (Cook's
    distance, covratio, covtrace, and MDFFITS) but also provides
    convenience functions and graphics for residual analysis. The package
    assumes that models were fit using the lme4 package.
Depends:
    lme4,
    ggplot2
Imports:
    stats,
    stats4,
    methods,
